            My name is Vedant Dabhade, and I enjoy <span class="default-highlight">turning ideas into scalable software solutions</span>.

          <p class="default-p">
            I am a Software Developer from India, fluent in English, and a Computer Engineering graduate with a strong foundation in <span class="default-highlight">.NET, Angular, and scalable full-stack architecture</span>.
          </p>
          <p class="default-p">
            My journey in development began with a passion for building practical solutions during college. Over time, I have worked on impactful projects like a <span class="default-highlight">Clean Architecture Web App</span> deployed on Azure, and a <span class="default-highlight">JWT-based Auth Management System</span>. These experiences helped me understand the value of clean code, layered architecture, and secure design patterns.
          </p>
          <p class="default-p">
            At <span class="default-highlight">ValueMomentum</span>, I’ve contributed to an enterprise insurance product using .NET APIs, Angular.js, and AG Grid. I've worked within Agile teams, followed SCRUM practices, and gained exposure to domain-driven design, CQRS, and JIRA-based workflows.
          </p>
          <p class="default-p">
            My skill set includes building responsive web interfaces, crafting RESTful APIs, handling secure authentication with <span class="default-highlight">JWT</span>, and deploying solutions on platforms like <span class="default-highlight">Azure</span> and <span class="default-highlight">Render</span>. I’ve also built backend systems using <span class="default-highlight">Node.js, Express</span>, and frontend apps with <span class="default-highlight">Angular and Tailwind CSS</span>.
          </p>
          <p class="default-p">
            I actively engage with <span class="default-highlight">DSA problems</span> to improve logic and problem-solving, with 400+ solved across platforms like LeetCode and GFG.
          </p>
          <p class="default-p">
            On a personal note, I love going to the <span class="default-highlight">gym</span>, experimenting with new tech stacks, and contributing to open-source projects whenever I get the chance. My curiosity and willingness to dive deep into documentation and technical challenges help me grow and push the boundaries of my skills.
          </p>
          <p class="default-p">
            I believe software has the power to simplify lives and empower change — and I’m excited to be part of that journey.
